Instead of using npx prisma migrate dev --name init to apply and track database schema changes, prisma db push can also be used to sync the schema. However, prisma migrate is generally preferred because it automatically creates migration files that keep a version history of changes, allowing for easier rollbacks and better collaboration on schema changes.
